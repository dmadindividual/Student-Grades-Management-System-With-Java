1. **Clone or download this repository.**

2. **Compile the program:**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the Java files. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   javac GradeSystem.java
   ```

3. **Run the program:**

   After successful compilation, you can run the program using this command:

   ```bash

   ```

4. **Interact with the program:**

## Code Explanation

### Student Class

- **Attributes:**
  - `student_name`: The name of the student.
  - `grades`: A `HashMap` to store subjects as keys and grades as values.

- **Methods:**
  - `add_grade(subject, student_grade)`: Adds a grade to the specified subject for the student.
  - `calculate_average()`: Calculates and returns the average grade of the student.
  - `display_student_info()`: Displays the student's name, grades, and average grade.

### GradeSystem Class (Main Program)

- **ArrayList<Student> studentList:** Stores the list of students.
- **Scanner scanner:** Used to read input from the user.

- **find_student(studentList, studentName):** Finds a student by their name (case-insensitive) in the list of students.

- **Menu Options:**
  - **Option 1:** Adds a new student to the list.
  - **Option 2:** Adds a grade for an existing student by entering their name, subject, and grade.
  - **Option 3:** Displays all student names, their grades, and their average grades.
  - **Option 4:** Exits the program.

## Example Usage

```bash
